V\+CU firmware is based upon 4 states\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \label{_f_s_m_STAND}%
\Hypertarget{_f_s_m_STAND}%
S\+T\+A\+ND\+: ignition of the car, you return here every time SC is undervoltage
\item \label{_f_s_m_HVON}%
\Hypertarget{_f_s_m_HVON}%
HV ON\+: active high voltage is only accessed from S\+T\+A\+ND via A\+I\+Rbutton and SC voltage $>$ 3V
\item \label{_f_s_m_DRIVE}%
\Hypertarget{_f_s_m_DRIVE}%
D\+R\+I\+VE\+: the safe driving status, accessible by R\+TD procedure but also with pedals implausibility through the return procedure
\item \label{_f_s_m_NOTDRIVE}%
\Hypertarget{_f_s_m_NOTDRIVE}%
N\+OT D\+R\+I\+VE\+: error with pedals, the sensors of the pedals are disconnected or out range. Torque request and braking request are disabled; you enter only by pedals implausibility or absence of the brake.
